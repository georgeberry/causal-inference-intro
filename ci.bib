	abstract = {Endogenous selection bias is a central problem for causal inference. Recognizing the problem, however, can be difﬁcult in practice. This article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous selection bias and of understanding its consequences (Herna´n et al. 2004). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g., controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables, one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable. We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias, common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous examples from social stratiﬁcation, cultural sociology, social network analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of education.},

@article{king_why_2015,
	title = {Why {Propensity} {Scores} {Should} {Not} {Be} {Used} for {Matching}},
	abstract = {Researchers use propensity score matching (PSM) as a data preprocessing step to selectively prune units prior to applying a model to estimate a causal effect. The goal of PSM is to reduce imbalance in pre-treatment covariates between the treated and control groups, thereby reducing the degree of model dependence and bias. We show here that PSM often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended — increasing imbalance, inefﬁciency, model dependence, research discretion and, bias. The weakness of PSM is that it attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more powerful fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM, unlike other matching methods, is thus blind to the often large portion of imbalance that could have been eliminated by approximating full blocking. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which turns out to increase imbalance. For other matching methods, the point where additional pruning increases imbalance occurs much later in the pruning process, when full blocking is approximated and there is no reason to prune, and so the danger is considerably less. We show that these problems with PSM occur even in data designed for PSM, with as few as two covariates, and in many real applications. Although these results suggest that researchers replace PSM with one of the other available methods when performing matching, propensity scores have many other productive uses.},

	title = {Causality},
	isbn = {978-0-521-89560-6},
	abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

	abstract = {The Rubin Causal Model (RCM), a framework for causal inference, has three distinctive features. First, it uses ‘potential outcomes’ to deﬁne causal effects at the unit level, ﬁrst introduced by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments and randomizationbased inference, but not used formally in non-randomized studies or with other modes of inference until Rubin (1974, 1975). Second is its formal use of a probabilistic assignment mechanism, which mathematically describes how treatments are given to units, with possible dependence on background variables and the potential outcomes themselves. Third is an optional probability distribution on all variables, including the potential outcomes, which thereby uniﬁes frequentist and modelbased forms of statistical inference for causal effects within one framework.},

	abstract = {The propensity score plays a central role in a variety of causal inference settings. In particular, matching and weighting methods based on the estimated propensity score have become increasingly common in the analysis of observational data. Despite their popularity and theoretical appeal, the main practical difﬁculty of these methods is that the propensity score must be estimated. Researchers have found that slight misspeciﬁcation of the propensity score model can result in substantial bias of estimated treatment effects. We introduce covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) methodology, which models treatment assignment while optimizing the covariate balance. The CBPS exploits the dual characteristics of the propensity score as a covariate balancing score and the conditional probability of treatment assignment. The estimation of the CBPS is done within the generalized method-of-moments or empirical likelihood framework. We ﬁnd that the CBPS dramatically improves the poor empirical performance of propensity score matching and weighting methods reported in the literature. We also show that the CBPS can be extended to other important settings, including the estimation of the generalized propensity score for non-binary treatments and the generalization of experimental estimates to a target population. Open source software is available for implementing the methods proposed.},
