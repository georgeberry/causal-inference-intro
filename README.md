## An introduction to causal inference

This repo contains the code to generate a PDF providing an intro to causal inference.

An Rmarkdown notebook generates this pdf, and also conducts some simulations along the way.

[You can find the PDF right here in this repo](https://github.com/georgeberry/causal-inference-intro/blob/master/causal-inference-intro.pdf) or on [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncvqs/).
